    <u><h2>MUSIC :</h2></u>
    	A person must learn to play at least one musical instrument in his life. <br />

        Music knows no language, true. The music is a medium to express your original feelings. I love listening to music and songs. Sometimes the music mesmerises me or sometimes the lyrics go deep in my mind.<br /><br />
        I like to play Guitar. I have learnt basic chords of guitar and I like to play lead most of the time.<br /><br />
        Some of my favourates are:<br />
        <ul>
        	<li>	Linkin Park</li>
            <li>	Need You Now - Lady Antebellum</li>
            <li>	Right Now - Akon</li>
            <li>	Aatif Aslam</li>
            <li>	Mirror's Edge</li>
            <li>	Running up that hill - Placebo</li>
            <li>	Voices - Randy Orton </li>
        </ul>
        
        The list is way too long. The above listed ones are just few of them.
