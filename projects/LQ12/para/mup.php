 <h3>INTRODUCTION:</h3>      
Over the years, engineering students have been found reinventing the wheel by focusing mostly on hardware development during their formative years instead of embedded software which is the dominant part of an embedded product development life-cycle. So here is an opportunity to develop and test your coding skills to develop for embedded applications. The EVENT aims at recognizing and rewarding the best talents in logic, creativity and software design.
