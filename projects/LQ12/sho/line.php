<h3>SPECIFICATIONS:</h3>
<h4>ARENA:</h4>
<ul>
<li>	Arena will be of 300 cm X 300 cm.</li>
<li>	Made with white sheet over that black tape.</li>
<li>	Tape is non-gloss type.</li>
</ul>
<h4>ROBOT SPECIFICATION:</h4>
<ul>
<li>	Each team has to build only one robot.</li>
<li>	The robot must be self control (no remote controls) without <b>using any type of embedded systems</b>.</li>
<li>	No Lego kits should be used or readymade robot should not be used, but ready made parts should be used.</li>
<li>	Robot must be fit in the box, dimensions of 200mmX150mmX150mm (LxBxH).</li>
<li>	Weight must be less than 0.5 kg.</li>
<li>	Robot should not use an energy source employing a combustion process.</li>
<li>	Robot should not leave any part of its body behind while negotiating the maze.</li>
<li>	Robot should not jump over, fly over, climb, scratch, cut, burn, mark, damage, or destroy the maze.</li>
<li>	Any violation of these rules will constitute immediate disqualification from the contest and ineligibility for the associated prizes.</li>
<li>	The robot should sense white as well as black lines.</li>
<li>	The use of castor wheel is allowed but it should be taken care that it shouldn't damage the lines of arena.</li>
</ul>

<h4>RULES AND REGULATIONS: </h4>
<ul>
<li>	A team may consist of maximum 4 participants.</li>
<li>	The robot shouldn't be controlled by any embedded systems and it should be work with the logics.</li>
<li>	All the participants will bring their own robotic kits. </li>
<li>	The width of the line which the bot will follow or run is of 3 cm.</li>
<li>	The judges reserve the right to ask the operator for an explanation of the Robot. The judges also reserve the right to stop a run, declare disqualification, or give instructions as appropriate (e.g., if the structure of the maze is jeopardized by continuing operation of the robot).
<ul><li>Judges decision is the final decision.</li>
<li>Change switch settings (e.g. to select algorithms)</li>
<li>Replace batteries between runs</li>
<li>Adjust sensors</li>
<li>Change speed settings</li>
<li>Make repairs</li></ul>
</li>

<li>	However, a contestant may not alter a robot in a manner that alters its weight (e.g. removal of a bulky sensor array or switching to lighter batteries to get better speed after mapping the maze is not allowed). The judges shall arbitrate.</li>
<li>	Any violation of these rules will constitute immediate disqualified from the contest and ineligibility for the associated prizes (Disqualification).</li>
</ul>
