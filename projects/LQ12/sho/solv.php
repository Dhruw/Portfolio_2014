	<H3>SPECIFICATIONS:</H3>
	<h4>ARENA:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>	Arena will be of 300 cm X 300 cm.</li>
		<li>	Made with white sheet over that black tape or black sheet over that white tape.</li>
		<li>	Tape is non-gloss type.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>ROBOT SPECIFICATION:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>	Each team has to build only one robot.</li>
		<li>	The robot must be self control (no remote controls).</li>
		<li>	Robot must be fit in the box, dimensions of 250mmX250mmX250mm.</li>
		<li>	No Lego kits should be used or readymade robot should not be used, but ready made parts should be used.</li>
		<li>	Weight must be less than 1 kg. </li>
		<li>	Robot should not use an energy source employing a combustion process.</li>
		<li>	Robot should not leave any part of its body behind while negotiating the maze.</li>
		<li>	Robot should not jump over, fly over, climb, scratch, cut, burn, mark, damage, or destroy the maze.</li>
		<li>	Any violation of these rules will constitute immediate disqualification from the contest and ineligibility for the associated prizes.</li>
		<li>	The robot should sense white as well as black lines.</li>
		<li>	The use of castor wheel is allowed but it should be taken care that it shouldn't damage the lines of arena.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4> RULES & REGULATIONS:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>	Each team consists of at most 4 members.</li>
		<li>	All the participants will bring their own robotic kits. </li>
		<li>	The run timer will start when front edge of the robot crosses the start line and stops when the front edge of the robot crosses the finish line. The start line is at the boundary between the starting unit cell and the next unit cell clockwise. The finish line is at the entrance to the destination cell.</li>
		<li>	The width of the line which the bot will follow or run is of 3 cm.</li>
		<li>	The judges reserve the right to ask the operator for an explanation of the Robot. The judges also reserve the right to stop a run, declare disqualification, or give instructions as appropriate (e.g., if the structure of the maze is jeopardized by continuing operation of the robot).</li>
		<li>	Judges decision is the final decision.</li>
		<li>	A contestant may not feed information on the maze to the Robot. Therefore, changing ROMs or downloading programs is NOT allowed on the maze. However, contestants are allowed to:</li>
		<li>	Change switch settings (e.g. to select algorithms)</li>
		<li>	Replace batteries between runs</li>
		<li>	Adjust sensors</li>
		<li>	Change speed settings</li>
		<li>	Make repairs</li>
		<li>	However, a contestant may not alter a robot in a manner that alters its weight (e.g. removal of a bulky sensor array or switching to lighter batteries to get better speed after mapping the maze is not allowed). The judges shall arbitrate.</li>
		<li>	Any violation of these rules will constitute immediate disqualified from the contest and ineligibility for the associated prizes (Disqualification).</li>
	</ul>
