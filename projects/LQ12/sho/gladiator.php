 <h3>INTRODUCTION:</h3>
Flying blades, violent flame throwers, the thrashing sound of metal and a junk pile of annihilated machines, welcome to the world of combat robotics. LaQshya  2012 brings to you Gladiators- the Inter college combat robotics competition, a modern day Coliseum for the next generation of war machines, the battle for supremacy can never get bigger than this...<br /> <br />
This is what we call "a real fight for glory"...................

<h3>SPECIFICATION:</h3>
<h4>ARENA:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>	Arena will be of square shape of sides 400cm x 400cm.</li>
	<li>	The arena is made up of <i>cement floor</i> and rubber painted surrounded by wire cage.</li>
</ul>

<h4>ROBOT:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>	The machine should fit in a box of dimensions 750mm X 750mm X 1000mm (L x B x H) at every given point of game. The external devices used to control the machine are not included in the size constraint.</li>
	<li>	The machine should not exceed 40kgs of weight.</li>
	<li>	The machine can be controlled wirelessly or with wires. Both <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> board power supplies are allowed.</li>
	<li>	If the machine is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition.</li>
	<li>	If the machine is controlled wirelessly, the machine must have a dual frequency remote control circuit or two control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of the race to avoid frequency interface with other teams.</li>
	<li>	Remote control systems available in market may be used.</li>
</ul>

<h4>SOURCE OF POWER:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>	The machine can be powered electrically only, use of IC engine in any form is not allowed.</li>
	<li>	Batteries must be sealed, immobilized electrolyte types (such as gel cells, lithium, NiCad, NiMH, or dry cells).</li>
	<li>	The electric voltage anywhere in the machine should not be more then 36V DC at any point of time.</li>
	<li>	All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire.</li>
</ul>

<h4>PNEUMATICS:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>	Robot can be use pressurized inflammable gases to activate pneumatic devices.</li>
	<li>	Maximum allowed pressure is 8 Bar.</li>
	<li>	Participants must be able to indicate the used pressure with integrated or temporarily fitted pressure gauge.</li>
	<li>	The maximum pressure in cylinder should not exceed the rated pressure at any point of time.</li>
</ul>

<h4>HYDRAULICS</h4>
<ul>
	<li>	Robot can use pressurized liquid to actuate hydraulic devices e.g. cylinders.</li>
	<li>	All hydraulic components onboard a robot must be securely mounted. Particular attention must be made to pump and accumulator mounting and armour to ensure that if ruptured direct fluid streams should not escape.</li>
	<li>	All hydraulic liquids are required to be non corrosive and your device should be leak proof.</li>
	<li>	Maximum allowed pressure is 8 bars.</li>
	<li>	Participant must be able to indicate the used pressure with integrated or temporarily fitted pressure gauge.</li>
</ul>

<h4>WEAPON SYSTEMS:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>	Robots can have any kind of cutters, flippers, saws, lifting devices etc as weapons with following exceptions and limitations:</li>
	<li>	Liquid Projectiles.</li>
	<li>	Any kind of flammable liquids.</li>
	<li>	Flame based weapons.</li>
	<li>	Any kind of explosive or intentionally ignited solid.</li>
	<li>	Nets, tape, glue, or any entanglement device.</li>
	<li>	Radio jamming, tazers, tesla coils, or any other high voltage device.</li>
	<li>	Un-tethered projectiles. </li>
	<li>	Tethered projectiles are allowed with a maximum tether length of 4 feet.</li>
</ul>

<br />
<h4>RULES AND REGULATIONS:</h4>
<ul>
<li>	A team may consist of maximum 6 participants.</li>
<li>	A robot is declared victorious if his opponent is immobilized.</li>
<li>	A competitor will be declared immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least one inch in a time period of 30 seconds. A robot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement.</li>
<li>	In case both the robots remain mobile after the end of the round the winner will be decided subjectively.</li>
<li>	Point will be given on the basis of <b>Aggression and Damage</b>.</li>
<li>	Duration of each match will be 3 minutes.</li>
<li>	Maximum Duration of <b>Semi Final</b> and <b>Final</b> match will be decided at the time of event..</li>
<li>	The machine would be checked for its safety before the game and would be discarded if found unsafe for other participants and spectators.</li>
<li>	All the participants will bring their own robotic kits.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Round 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>This will be a knock out round.</li>
<li>Two teams will play against each other and based upon point scored, they will be qualifying for the next round.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Round 2</h4>
<ul><li>In this round, again a knock out match will be played.</li>
<li>The teams will get qualified for the next round on the basis of following criterion:<br />
a)	If the opponent becomes immobile during match.<br />
b)	In case both of the bot are in mobile condition for the whole match duration, the decision will be taken on the basis of point secured.
</li>
<li>The number of qualifying teams will be decided on the spot</li>
</ul>
<h4>SAFETY RULES:</h4>
<ul>
<li>	All participants build and operate robots at their own risk. Combat robotics is inherently dangerous. There is no amount of regulations that can encompass all the dangers involved. Please take care not to hurt yourself or others when building, testing, and competing.</li>
<li>	If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the set categories of rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers.</li>
<li>	All weapons must have a safety cover on sharp edges.</li>
</ul>
