	<p>I used to do painting when I was a kid. As coming of age I came in contact with computers. My "painting" transformed into "graphic designing" as the technologies blended with my persona. I still like drawing and painting. I draw caricatures when i'm idle. I also like photography and image processing. This is a vast and infinite field; and I love it.<br /><br />
    You can see my art on <a href="http://www.divyanshudhruw.deviantart.com"> www.divyanshudhruw.deviantart.com </a> also, it is an artist community website.</p>
